## FAQ Responses

**Q: What is an AI agent?**
A: An AI agent is a smart software assistant that can handle tasks automatically—like responding to customer emails, scheduling meetings, or processing data. Think of it as a virtual team member that works 24/7 without breaks.

**Q: Do I need technical knowledge?**
A: No. We handle all technical complexity. You tell us what tasks take up your team's time, and we build and implement the solution.

**Q: What makes AI agents different from traditional automation?**
A: Traditional automation follows rigid rules and breaks with unexpected inputs. AI agents understand context, handle variations, and make intelligent decisions. They adapt without reprogramming.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**
A: Most projects complete in 2-6 weeks. We start with a pilot to prove ROI before scaling.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Absolutely. We build AI systems you own and control. Your data stays on your infrastructure or in secure, private environments. Never shared with third parties.
